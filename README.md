# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI

This repository contains a Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation in Python3, where a player ('X') competes against an AI opponent ('O'). The AI can take use the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, or a more heuristic algorithim for a more relaxed experience.

# Features
**Two Players:** Human player and AI opponent.
**Minimax AI:** The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to decide the best possible move.
**Random AI (optional):** A random AI can also be used as an alternative opponent.
**Command-Line Interface:** The game is played in the terminal, with user input for move coordinates.
**Game State Updates:** The game board is displayed after each move, showing the current state of the game.

# How to Play
**Player 'X'** goes first, entering coordinates for their move (row and column).
**AI 'O'** will then make a move based on the Minimax algorithm to try to block or win.
The game continues alternating between the player and AI until one wins, or the board is full (draw).

# Possible Future Updates
* User decides on difficulty during gameplay
* A more refined heuristic AI
* Front-end component for better visualization
